Hello and welcome to the official AUN repository on github, created by @vyPal! If you don't know what (or who) AUN is, then read here!
AUN is an opensource Discord bot written in 100% JavaScript. Since AUN is opensource you can go into the code, grab a bit that you need, and use it in your bot! But please do not just copy and paste the bot code. That would be stealing. Otherwise be shure to invite AUN to your discord servers: [Top.gg invite link](https://top.gg/bot/808613132850561055), and if you see anything that you would like me to add, or something that is broken, be shure to use the discussions tab here on GitHub, or join the Discord chat room using the chat badge above.
